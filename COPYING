Note that a few specific files are under different licensing terms. This
is clearly stated at the top of the file. Currently the paths of these
files are as follows.

src/x86_decode.c
src/x86_emulate.h
src/x86_defs.h

Note also that building this software involves downloading and compiling
source code from other projects (collected under the contrib/
directory). Consequently, the output binaries (trap-syscalls.so,
libsystrap.a, and others) are, in some cases, subject to licensing terms
imposed by those projects. To determine the terms applying to a binary
you have built, one reliable method is to use the debugging information
in that binary to establish which source files it embodies.
